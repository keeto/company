Company
=======

**Company** is an implicitly-mediated component system for MooTools that helps in developing modular, component-based applications.

Company was developed as an advanced, alternative system to the basic event-based module systems described in the Keetology article, [Modules and Callbacks: Going Hollywood with MooTools][modules_and_callbacks]. It requires MooTools 1.3 Core and above.

Please refer to the API Docs and the Company Guide found in the `Docs` directory for more information on how to use Company and the features included. You can also checkout the `Examples` directory for sample usage of the system.
